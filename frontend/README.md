# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Setup Guide

This guide includes troubleshooting steps for the React application startup issue and instructions for managing Node.js versions using NVM (Node Version Manager).

## Troubleshooting React Application Startup Issue

If you encounter a startup issue with your React application, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

### 1. **Clear the npm Cache**

Sometimes, the npm cache might get corrupted. Clearing it can help ensure that you download fresh copies of each package.

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

### 2. **Delete `node_modules` and Reinstall Dependencies**

Remove the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file (if it exists) to ensure a clean slate for reinstalling the dependencies.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 3. **Check for the Correct Versions**

Ensure that the versions of `react-scripts`, `eslint-webpack-plugin`, and other related dependencies in your `package.json` are compatible. If unsure about the versions, specify versions that are known to work well together or use the latest stable versions.

### 4. **Update `react-scripts`**

If you're not using the latest version of `react-scripts`, consider upgrading, as newer versions often have fixes for common issues:

```bash
npm install react-scripts@latest
```

### 5. **Check Your Node.js Version**

Ensure that your Node.js version is compatible with the libraries you are using. Update your Node.js to a compatible version if needed.

### 6. **Look for Open Issues or Bug Reports**

Check the GitHub repositories for `react-scripts`, `eslint-webpack-plugin`, and `jest-worker` to see if this is a known issue.

### 7. **Revert to a Previous Working State**

If the issue started after updating any dependencies, consider reverting to a previous state where the setup was working.

### 8. **Isolate the Issue**

Try creating a fresh project with `create-react-app` and manually adding your dependencies one at a time. This can help identify if the problem is with a specific package or configuration.

## Managing Node.js Versions with NVM

Node Version Manager (NVM) allows you to quickly install and switch between different versions of Node.js, which is particularly useful when working on multiple projects with different Node.js requirements.

### Install NVM

To install NVM, run one of the following commands in your terminal. These commands download and run the NVM installation script:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
# or
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

After installing, close and reopen your terminal, then verify that NVM is installed by checking its version:

```bash
nvm --version
```

### Install Node.js

With NVM installed, you can now install any version of Node.js. For example, to install Node.js version 14 (which is compatible with `react-scripts` version 4.0.3), use the following command:

```bash
nvm install 14
nvm use 14
```

### Switching Between Node.js Versions

If you have multiple versions of Node.js installed, you can switch between them using:

```bash
nvm use <version_number>
```

### Setting a Default Node.js Version

To set a default Node.js version that automatically activates whenever you open a new terminal, run:

```bash
nvm alias default <version_number>
```

### Additional Commands

- **List installed Node.js versions:**
  ```bash
  nvm ls
  ```
- **List available Node.js versions for installation:**
  ```bash
  nvm ls-remote
  ```
- **Uninstall a Node.js version:**
  ```bash
  nvm uninstall <version_number>
  ```

Using these commands, you can manage multiple Node.js versions on a single machine without conflicts between projects.
